# Project Outline
Using the Google Maps API, show a map of your local area, with your location as a blue marker.

EXTRA:

1. Show the 3 restaurants in a 3km radius with the highest star rating with a yellow marker and show the name + rating of each restaurant.   
2. Add a button for each restaurant that shows directions from you to the restaurant.  

# Important things!!! PLEASE READ!!

1. To use the API as needed in this project, you need a API key registered under a billing account. Since I have a registered account, you can use my API key, which Mrs. Wear will give you (I can't post it on a public repository). Once you get the key, there will be an HTML <script> tag you need (you can find on the "initilizing map" link and it will have a space in the link that says "API_KEY" You need to replace that with the key you get emailed. 
Be happy. Receiving this key makes your life a lot easier. 

2. Here are some links that will also help you with various requirments of the project. 
- Initilizing the map: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/adding-a-google-map?hl=en_US  
- When you receive a response for your search request it will look like this: https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/search#PlaceSearchResponses This is where you can access the "Rating" of the restaurant
- When searching for the restaurants, the API has a built in service called "nearby search" learn about it here: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/places#place_search_requests
